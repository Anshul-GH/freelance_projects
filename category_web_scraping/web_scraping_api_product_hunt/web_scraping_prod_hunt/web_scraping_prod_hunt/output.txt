Welcome to the Product Hunt API 2.0
The goal of this API is to provide access to Product Hunt data via a simple
GraphQL   interface.
If you have any ideas for improvements or just wanna chat about queries or mutations
let us know on GitHub.   Remember to add   v2   label to the issue.
Not familiar with GraphQL?
Here are some resources that can help you get started with GraphQL.

How To GraphQL   - a free and open-source tutorial to learn all around GraphQL to go from zero to production.
Privileges
There are 3 types of scopes that an application can request on behalf of the user:
Public :   Access public information on Product Hunt.
Private :   Access Product Hunt on behalf of the authenticated user. For e.g application will be able to read goals of the user.
Write :   Take actions on Product Hunt on behalf of the user. For e.g application will be able to mark user's goals as complete/incomplete.
For example, if you are building an application in which you need to know if a user has followed a topic, or commented on a post, you would need to request   `public private`   scope.
By default   all apps are read-only   i.e they have   `public`   scope.
As part of API 2.0 we have decided to give   partial write access   to third party applications depending on the use-case. If your application needs it
feel free to get in touch with us at   hello@producthunt.com  . Remember you would also need to request   `public private write`   scope
for write functions to work.
The Product Hunt API must not be used for commercial purposes. If you would like to use it for
your business, please contact us at   hello@producthunt.com  .
Accessing Endpoints
The API is reachable at   https://api.producthunt.com/v2/api/graphql
Currently the API is only accessible with a provided   access_token  .
We reserve the right to rate-limit any application if we feel you are not following   fair-use  .
If you require faster access without rate limit please contact us.
Get started: Getting an OAuth2 token
Get a token on behalf of a user:
Follow the steps in   OAuth User Authentication   oauth#authorize to receive an access_grant
Use the access_grant in oauth#token
Add the   Authorization   http header with the token to all requests. E.g   Authorization: Bearer {token}
Test this and troubleshoot according to the examples in oauth#test
Get a token without user context. (eg before a user logs in)
Follow the steps explained in   OAuth Client Only Authentication   oauth#token
Please remember that this tokens limit you to public endpoints that don't require user context.
But… i just wanted to run a simple script?
The oauth2 flow is a bit of a overkill if you just want to run a few scripts
We provide a developer_token (does not expire, linked to your account) in the
app dashboard

Are there any other ways to do Product Hunt Integrations?
Yes! There is quite a bunch of third party APIs. Blazin' fast fulltext search,
SDKs with callbacks for real-time like interaction, web-hooks, etc etc.
Go here for the   full list  .
Btw there is also a lot of Open Source software out there.
Take a look  .
Maybe there is something you can reuse.
But…?
